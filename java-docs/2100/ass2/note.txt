here are two (2) parts to this assignment. Begin EACH on a NEW PAGE in your document.
1. Discuss any problems you can find in the letter in well-written sentences and paragraphs. Be sure your discussion covers formatting, style, structure, and content issues. Be thorough.
2. Re-write the complaint letter using the proper business letter format. Remove anything that should not be present, move information around if it is in the wrong location, and add anything that is missing. You may invent information if need be (e.g. addresses, dates, etc.), but don't be fanciful.
The letter must look like a properly-formatted letter. Use the business letter format discussed in class.
Submission
• Make sure your document adheres to the CRAP design principles.
• Submit a professional-looking document. How you lay out the document is up to you, but it must not look like something you threw together at the last minute. Each part must start on its own page.
• Submit a PDF. A document in any other format will receive a grade of zero (0).
