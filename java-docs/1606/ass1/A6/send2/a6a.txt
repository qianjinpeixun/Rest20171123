CSCI 2132 Software Development Assignment 6 Solutions for Question 2a:
Input:
	The input of function f1 has two parameters: 
	The first is (int n), it means the index of the second parameter as an int array. 
	The second is (int a[]), it is an integer array.
Output:
	The output of this function is an integer, it will return 0 for each call.
How to work:
	The feature of this function is to put the indexâ€™s value into the first position in the array, and then shift the others to next position one by one till the position of index.

Ilustrate its input and output on a small example with n = 5:
	For example, n =5 , a = {1,2,3,4,5}
	1. Initially, the array a is {1,2,3,4,5},int *p=a, means that pointer p equals a, tmp=a[n-1]=a[4]=5
	2. in the for loop, n - - means position moves from the last to forward, p ++ means the position moves from the front to rear.
	
	First loop, *p is 1, tmp is 5, the end of this loop, array is: 5 2 3 4 5, tmp becomes 1, n becomes 5
	Second loop, *p is 2, tmp is 1, the end of this loop, array is: 5 1 3 4 5, tmp becomes 2, n becomes 4
	Third loop, *p is 3, tmp is 2, the end of this loop, array is: 5 1 2 4 5, tmp becomes 3, n becomes 3
	Fourth loop, *p is 4, tmp is 3, the end of this loop, array is: 5 1 2 3 5, tmp becomes 4, n becomes 2
	Fifth loop, *p is 5, tmp is 4, the end of this loop, array is: 5 1 2 3 4, tmp becomes 5,  n becomes 1
	After fifth loop, n becomes 0, jump out the loop, return is 0
