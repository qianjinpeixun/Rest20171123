i.e., must count as the same uppercase and lowercase letters.
The count is the number of times a letter occured in text, while
frequency is a fraction of time the letter occured divided by the
total number of letters.  (Be careful to avoid dividing by zero!)

Any characters between letters, i.e, between words, are counted as a
simple space character, which is printed as an underscore (`\verb,_,')
character.
