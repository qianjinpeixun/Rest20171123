Please Enter the value of the number 4 node: 4
Please Enter the value of the number 5 node: 5
Please Enter the value of the number 6 node: 6
Please Enter the value of the number 7 node: 7
The inorder of the tree is as follows:
1	2	3	4	5	6	7	
Exercise 1, the largest key in the binary search tree is: 7
Exercise 2, the smallest key in the binary search tree is: 1
Exercise 3, please enter the numbers which you want to search in the tree: 4
The search result is: 4
Exercise 4, how many nodes do you want to have for a tree?3
Please enter the value of the number 1 node: 2
Please enter the value of the number 2 node: 1
Please enter the value of the number 3 node: 3
The inorder of the new tree is:
1	2	3	
This tree is a binary search tree!
