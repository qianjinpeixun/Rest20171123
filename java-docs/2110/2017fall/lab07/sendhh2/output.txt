Firstly, We will create a binary search tree with 6 nodes:
What's the value of node 1? 1
What's the value of node 2? 2
What's the value of node 3? 3
What's the value of node 4? 4
What's the value of node 5? 5
What's the value of node 6? 6

Start to create the first tree for testsing.
Step 1, FindMax=6
Step 2, FindMin=1
Please enter the value for searching: 1
Step 3, Found it, value is:1
Firstly, We will create a tree with 6 nodes.
What's the value of node 1? 1
What's the value of node 2? 2
What's the value of node 3? 3
What's the value of node 4? 4
What's the value of node 5? 5
What's the value of node 6? 6

Start to create the tree for testsing.

Inorder:
6	4	2	5	1	3	
No, it is not a binary search tree!

Firstly, We will create a binary search tree with 7 nodes.
What's the value of node 1? 1
What's the value of node 2? 2
What's the value of node 3? 3
What's the value of node 4? 4
What's the value of node 5? 5
What's the value of node 6? 6
What's the value of node 7? 7

Start to create the tree for testsing.

Inorder:
1	2	3	4	5	6	7	
Yes, it's a binary search tree!
