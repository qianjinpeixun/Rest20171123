Firstly, We will create a tree with 6 nodes:
What's the value of node 1? 1
What's the value of node 2? 2
What's the value of node 3? 3
What's the value of node 4? 4
What's the value of node 5? 5
What's the value of node 6? 6

Start to create the first tree for testsing.
Start to print the tree:
Preorder:	1	2	4	6	5	3	
Inorder:	6	4	2	5	1	3	
Postorder:	6	4	5	2	3	1	
Number of Nodes:	6
Height:	4
This tree is not balanced	
Levelorder:	1	2	3	4	5	6	



Secondly, We will create another tree with 6 nodes:
What's the value of node 1? a
What's the value of node 2? b
What's the value of node 3? c
What's the value of node 4? d
What's the value of node 5? e
What's the value of node 6? f

Start to create the first tree for testsing.
Start to print the tree:
Preorder:	a	b	c	d	e	f	
Inorder:	b	d	f	e	c	a	
Postorder:	f	e	d	c	b	a	
Number of Nodes:	6
Height:	6
This tree is not balanced	
Levelorder:	a	b	c	d	e	f	



Finally, We will create the third tree with 7 nodes:
What's the value of node 1? 1
What's the value of node 2? 2
What's the value of node 3? 3
What's the value of node 4? 4
What's the value of node 5? 5
What's the value of node 6? 6
What's the value of node 7? 7

Start to create the third tree for testsing.
Start to print the tree:
Preorder:	1	2	4	6	5	3	7	
Inorder:	6	4	2	5	1	7	3	
Postorder:	6	4	5	2	7	3	1	
Number of Nodes:	7
Height:	4
This tree is balanced	
Levelorder:	1	2	3	4	5	7	6
